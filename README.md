# Network-Designing
The standard application is to a problem like phone network design. You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. It should be a spanning tree, since if a network isnâ€™t a tree you can always remove some edges and save money. Design a network to connect several offices with minimum cost.
